Pandas provides a wide range of functions for data analysis, including reading and writing data from various sources, cleaning data, merging and joining datasets, and more.
#NumPy
NumPy is a Python library that is used for scientific computing and data analysis. It provides a wide range of mathematical functions and operations that can be performed on arrays and matrices. NumPy is built on top of Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures and provides a more efficient way to work with large datasets.
#Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python library that is used for data visualization. It provides a wide range of functions for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib is built on top of NumPy and provides a convenient interface for creating plots, charts, and graphs.
#Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a Python library that provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms for both supervised and unsupervised learning. 
#Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
#importing Libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
